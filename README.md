# Nigerian Covid Data
  Considering covid-19 plagued the world throughout 2020 bringing major markets & livelihoods to a halt, I thought it would be a good idea to see just how much this pandemic affected my country from 2020 to 2022 and how many people were directly affected. 

The subnational data about Covid19 in Nigeria per day - Infections (new cases), Deaths, Recoveries + Gender data per region. 
This Data was gotten of this [website](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/nigeria_covid19_subnational).

- Jupyter Notebooks was used in the cleaning process of the data which had many missing values. This was done through filling those missing values with the calculared average across the columns that had the missing values. There were a total of over 250 thousand plus patients over the course of a 3 year period from 2020 to 2022.
- The visualisation was done through Tableau, showcasing the Country and which states/Region housed the most cases, those cured and unfortuneately the deaths that occured. Here is a link to the [dashboard]()

There are six steps used in completing this analysis:
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act
